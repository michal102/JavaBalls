# JavaBalls
a simple elastic collision program

![image of my balls](images/main_balls_crop.png)

Balls change color based on density (shifting towards red when the density is high) and brightness based on collision amount.

Program also has a settings menu implemented, where you can change properties of balls and methods used to calculate collisions.
